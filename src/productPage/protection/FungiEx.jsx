              <p className="leading-relaxed">Fungi-Ex is a green alternative to synthetic fungicide
                especially to control soil borne fungal diseases. It
                contains Clove extract and some biomolecules that
                are considered as potential source for treating fungal
                diseases in plants. It has a good antifungal activity
                and shows inhibitory effect against many fungal
                diseases

              <h3 className="text-gray-900 text-2xl title-font font-medium m-3">KEY FEATURES
              </h3>
              <p className='leading-relaxed m-4'>Botanical extract based fungicide against soil
                borne fungal pathogens and few others. <br />
                The extracts present shows maximum activity
                and the same effect as chemical fungicide. <br />
                Offers bioactive compounds for growth
                inhibition of the fungi. <br />
                Stimulates plant's natural defence response
                against pathogen attack. <br />
                As it is an organic input, there will not be any
                side effects
              </p>



              <h3 className="text-gray-900 text-2xl title-font font-medium m-3">MODE OF ACTION</h3>
              <p className='leading-relaxed m-4'>The ingredients have both a direct and an indirect effect on oomycetes. They inhibitive
                oxidative phosphorylation in the metabolism of oomycetes. It also has an indirect effect by
                stimulating the plant's natural defence response against pathogen attack
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-gray-900 text-2xl title-font font-medium m-3">TARGET CROPS </h3>
